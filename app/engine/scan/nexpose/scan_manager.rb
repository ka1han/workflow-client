# == Synopsis
# Used to start site device scans where a user is able to specify the maximum amount of scans that
# should be running at a time.  This class does not guarantee that there will be no more than the
# maximum amount of scans specified will be running BUT scans will not be started from this class
# until the current amount of scans running is less than or equal to the maximum.
