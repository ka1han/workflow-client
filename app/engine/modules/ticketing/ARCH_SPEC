FAILSAFE:
	To ensure ticketing is failsafe there are a couple steps that should be followed to ensure there are no loss of tickets or duplication:

 	1.	A DB record of all scans processed per module should be recorded
 	2.	Before tickets are processed they should be loaded into the DB 'tickets_to_be_created'
 		DB Columns:
 		* host
        * ticket_data
	3.	Each time a ticket is successfully created it should be removed from the DB and the ticket ID stored in the DB 'tickets_created'
	    * host
	    * module_name
	    * ticket_id


DUPLICATION AVOIDANCE:
There will always be a record for each ticket created, it will be just two rows in the DB: module_name/ticket_id
ticket_id = <ticket_system: device_id/site_name/nsc_name> + port + vuln_id + vkey
