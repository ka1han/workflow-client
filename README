== Rapid7 Workflow Engine

#####
GOAL:
#####
To provide a method of integrating 3rd party applications with Rapid7 products.

##########
TICKETING:
##########
Currently a module is implemented which allows users to setup
Nexpose as an input source and a ticketing software as an output,
such as: JIRA, Nexpose (Nexpose ticketing) and SOAP supported endpoints.

#######
SCOPES:
#######
Current supported scopes are:
----------------------------------------
Ticket per Vulnerability per Device
Ticket per Vulnerability
Ticket per Device

Currently, closed-loop ticketing is supported for JIRA 4 for the Ticket per Vuln per Device scope. 
Closed-loop ticketing is the ability to find a vulnerability on the networkin during a scan,
then check later scans to see if the vulnerability has been fixed and resolve the ticket created
from a prior scan.
