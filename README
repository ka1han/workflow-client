== Rapid7 Workflow Engine

#####
GOAL:
#####
To provide a method of integrating 3rd party applications with Rapid7 products.

##############
AUTHENTICATION
##############
When you start Nexflow for the first time, you will be required to create an Authentication Console.
An authentication console is a Nexpose instance which is used to authenticate against.
You can configure as may Authentication consoles as you would like.
However, at least one auth console is required for nexflow to function.

##########
TICKETING:
##########
Currently a module is implemented which allows users to setup
Nexpose as an input source and a ticketing software as an output,
such as: JIRA, Nexpose (Nexpose ticketing) and SOAP supported endpoints.

#######
SCOPES:
#######
Current supported scopes are:
----------------------------------------
Ticket per Vulnerability per Device
Ticket per Vulnerability
Ticket per Device

Currently, closed-loop ticketing is supported for JIRA 4 for the Ticket per Vuln per Device scope. 
Closed-loop ticketing is the ability to find a vulnerability on the networkin during a scan,
then check later scans to see if the vulnerability has been fixed and resolve the ticket created
from a prior scan.

##########
SOAP WSDL:
##########
Nexflow has the ability to consume a generic SOAP WSDL and create post tickets with defined tokens.
This is the Generic SOAP ticket module option when creating your output module.
The tokens are replaced with the ticket data from scans prior to being posted to the SOAP endpoint.
